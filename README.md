Earth Guides: Rediscovering our Lost Guides, is a project merging art, science, and community engagement to reconnect people with nature. Through participatory mapping and immersive experiences, it invites individuals to rediscover their relationship with the natural world and become stewards of the Earth's diverse landscapes guided by more-then-human ancestral guides.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Earth Guides is a project designed to rekindle our connection with nature through a participatory map and immersive virtual gallery. At its core, it serves as a tool for re-membering our lost guides – the often overlooked relationships between humans and the more-than-human world.

The project leverages technology to create digital twins of distinct ecosystems, enriching the physical landscapes with living archives of their biomes. Through observation and collaboration, participants are invited to build ecological relationships with the inhabitants of these places, fostering a deeper understanding of their interconnectedness.

Earth Guides actively invites citizens to become artists and scientists, engaging in real-life interactions and contributing their knowledge to the map. By uploading their experiences and insights, participants collectively create a rich archive of relationships with other species and the land itself, re-animating the present and instigating a new paradigm of presence.

Key features of Earth Guides (#pilotphase) will include:

Participatory mapping:
Digital twins of three unique locations serve as interactive art and science maps. We are starting with Błędowska Desert in Poland, followed by Tempelhofer Feld in Berlin, and Liberose Wüste in Brandenburg, Germany.

Citizen engagement:
The project encourages individuals to become active participants in landscape analysis, data collection, path creation, and monitoring.

Community-driven gameplay:
A participatory citizens’ game transforms the map into a collaborative board, fostering interaction and exploration.

Guardianship of the land:
Inhabitants of these ecosystems, both human and non-human, are recognized as guardians and elders of the land.

As Earth Guides evolves, it has the potential to expand into a dynamic game experience, empowering participants to become true guardians of the desert and stewards of the Earth's diverse landscapes.

We imagine an app that notifies you when you pass art and science spaces embedded in the land and prompts to encourage participation and rewilding of the imagination. This way of engagement becomes less about participation with the screen and more about the relationality within ecosystems, particularly those that are described as either “unoccupied” as desert’s or “human only” as parks like Templehofer Feld.

Sustainability:
The key aspect of the participatory map is sustainability in relation to building ecological relations, as well as in the future by allowing the map to develop into a tool for virtual sustainable tourism and traveling. Creating digital twins of ecosystems, Earth Guides aim at optimizing resource utilization. Through participatory mapping and immersive experiences, it maximizes long-term viability by engaging diverse community members in landscape analysis, data collection, and collaborative gameplay. This approach not only enriches physical landscapes with living archives but also fosters broad access and benefits, empowering individuals to become active stewards of Earth's diverse ecosystems.

ICP compliance:

Earth Guides utilizes the ICP to decentralize its platform, allowing for better integration of real-time data and updates. By leveraging ICP, the project ensures high scalability and resilience, enabling smooth user experiences, offering  a decentralized way of participation. We here use ICP as a proof of concept towards the community regarding web3, but also we want our user to be able to vote with a token towards the markers / projects (i.e. art installations)  on the card that touches them. The token here helps to see where and what we could do better. We want the user to think of the ICP as a map to explore, a graph of all the joy and energy offered to whom they can give weight by using tokens, allowing us to harness the collective intelligence into a more fulfilling community for the members.

Action plan:
Stage 1. Creating a prototype of the map for Błędowska Desert (Code 2 Community hackathon and weeks following); creating a prototype of the Tempelhofer Feld map and Lieberose Wüste (April;

Stage 2. Testing of the prototype run by LIOS Labs and MOOS Community involving citizens of Berlin and the local inhabitant of Błędowska Desert, Poland during Desert Transformation Lab 2024 (www.lios.io/deerttransformationlab; June and July); participation, data collection, monitoring #PilotPhase;
Stage 3. Data analysis incl. Engagement analysis and data analysis (September, October)

Stage 4. Technological development: AR app and game design and ICP optimisation; (November, December);

Stage 5.  Launching of the Earth Guides #beta (January 2025)
Next stages: testing, data collection & analysis; upgrades; testing for new use within Nature preservation and ecological education #CitizenScience #CitizenArt;
