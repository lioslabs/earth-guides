# earth-guides
Earth Guides: Rediscovering our Lost Guides, is a project merging art, science, and community engagement to reconnect people with nature. Through participatory mapping and immersive experiences, it invites individuals to rediscover their relationship with the natural world and become stewards of the Earth's diverse landscapes guided by more-then-human ancestral guides.
